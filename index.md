## Welcome to the AthensLab Ethereum Developer Companion

This website has been developed as a companion to the Consensys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp and is designed as a series of structured links and content, that when followed over four months, will provide you with the basic knowledge to develop decentralised applications.



## Learning Outcomes


By Following the Companion,  learners will be able to show evidence of:

1.Describe Blockchain primitives and basics and give examples for their usage.

2.Prepare and demonstrate setting up a development environment for Ethereum.

3.Compose basic Smart contracts and their tests and deploy them in a test environment.

4.Produce an evaluation of common security issues in smart contracts.

5.Build, Deploy and showcase a decentralised application on Ethereum.

Indicative Learner Workload: Minimum 10 hours per week, with at least 4 hours per week hands-on practice. / Recommended Learner Workload:
20 hours per week, with 10 hours per week devoted to hands-on practice. 5 hours per week, spent on theory, fundamentals and seminars.

## “Ethereum” Basics
- [Ethereum "pre-history"](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html) Vitalik Buterin blog post)
Interesting to read as Buterin goes through the internal thought process of creating a fee based ledger that is Turing complete, i.e a state machine. Note the simplicity of the programmatic loop the devises to validate his concept

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AthensLab/Blockchain_Development_curriculum/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
